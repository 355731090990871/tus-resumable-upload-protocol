# tus resumable upload protocol

**Version:** 0.1 ([SemVer](http://semver))<br>
**Authors:** [Felix Geisend√∂rfer](https://twitter.com/felixge), [Kevin van Zonneveld](https://twitter.com/kvz)

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## Status

This protocol is under development and is not ready for general adoption yet.

The goal is to have 1.0 release candidate in a few weeks, at which point only
minor revision will be made to the protocol. After a few months 1.0 will be
frozen, and changes will be considered very carefully. Ideally there will be no
need for a version 2.0.

## Contributing

This protocol is authored and owned by the tus community. We welcome patches
and feedback via
[Github](https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol). All contributors
will be listed as authors.

Please also let us know about any implementations (open source or commercial)
if you'd like to be listed on the
[implementations](http://www.tus.io/implementations.html) page.

## Abstract

The protocol describes the use of a subset of [RFC
2616](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) (HTTP 1.1) in order to achieve a
[RESTful](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm)
mechanism for resumable file uploads.

## Example: Resumable Upload

The example below is meant to give you a quick overview over the protocol, but
is not part of the protocol definition.

A new file resource is created by sending a POST request to an URL defined by
the server:

**Request:**

```
POST /files HTTP/1.1
Host: tus.example.org
Content-Length: 0
Content-Range: bytes */100
Content-Type: image/jpeg
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="cat.jpg"'
```
```
<empty body>
```

**Response:**

```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: http://tus.example.org/files/24e533e02ec3bc40c387f1a0e460e216
Content-Length: 0
```

After being assigned a resource `Location`, the client starts the actual
upload:

**Request Example:**

```
PUT /files/24e533e02ec3bc40c387f1a0e460e216 HTTP/1.1
Host: tus.example.org
Content-Length: 100
Content-Range: bytes 0-99/100
```
```
<bytes 0-99>
```

**Response Example:**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Range: bytes=0-99
Content-Length: 0
```

In this case, the upload succeeded. However, if there had been a network error
during the `PUT` request, the client could have also resumed this upload:

```
HEAD /files/24e533e02ec3bc40c387f1a0e460e216 HTTP/1.1
Host: tus.example.org
```

**Response Example:**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Content-Length: 100
Content-Type: image/jpg
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="cat.jpg"'
Range: bytes=0-69
```

The `Range` tells the client how much data made it to the server, so he
can continue from there:

```
PUT /files/24e533e02ec3bc40c387f1a0e460e216 HTTP/1.1
Host: tus.example.org
Content-Length: 30
Content-Range: bytes 70-99/100
```
```
<bytes 70-99>
```

**Response Example:**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Range: bytes=0-99
Content-Length: 0
```

## Protocol

### Error Handling

Well defined error handling is the core of this protocol, so it is the first
thing you should pay attention to.

Servers MUST use appropriate http status codes for all error responses. In
particular, they MUST use `400 Bad Request` for invalid requests, `501 Not
Implemented` for unsupported features and `500 Internal Error` for internal
problems.

Both clients and servers SHOULD attempt to detect and handle network errors
predictably. They may do so by checking for read/write socket errors, as well
as setting read/write timeouts. Both clients and servers SHOULD use a 30 second
timeout. A timeout SHOULD be handled by closing the underlaying socket.

Servers SHOULD always attempt to process partial messages bodies in order to
store as much of the received data as possible.

Clients SHOULD use a randomized exponential back off strategy before repeating
requests or resuming uploads interrupted due to network errors as well as after
receiving a `500 Internal Error`. It is up to the client to decide to give up
at some point.

### Creating file resources

A server SHOULD define one or more fixed URLs for clients to create new file
resources via `POST` requests (e.g `/files`).  A client MAY indicate the
desired location for the new resource (e.g. `/files/sha1sum`), but MUST be
prepared to receive a different `Location` header in the server response.

All file resource creation requests MUST include a `Content-Range` and
`Content-Length` header.

The `Content-Length` defines the amount of bytes included in the request body.
For resumable uploads it SHOULD be set to `0`, but clients MAY choose to upload
some or all bytes of a file when creating it.

The `Content-Range` defines the total size of the file, and optionally the data
range included in the body of the request. When `Content-Length` is `0`, the
`Content-Range` MUST be given as `bytes */100` where `100` is the total size of
the file. For `Content-Length` values larger than `0`, the `Content-Range` MUST
take the form `bytes 0-2/100` when sending the first `3` bytes of a `100` byte
message. In this case the `Content-Length` would be 3. For simplicity, servers
MAY choose to implement support for ranges beginning at an offset of 0.

A valid request MUST be acknowledged with a `201 Created` status by the server.
The response MUST also include a `Location` header that holds the absolute URL
of the created file resource.

Clients and servers MAY choose to include additional headers for application
specific purposes, such as `Content-Type`, `Content-Disposition`, etc. to
provide meta information or processing directives to the server.


... continue work here ...

A completed upload will be indicated by a single range covering the entire file
size (e.g. `Range: bytes=0-99` for a 100 byte file).

**Note** If the server has not received anything so far, there will be no `Range`
header present.

**Request Example:**

The request below creates an empty file resource against a tus endpoint at
`http://tus.example.org/files`.

```
POST /files HTTP/1.1
Host: tus.example.org
Content-Length: 0
Content-Range: bytes */100
```
```
<empty body>
```

**Response Example:**

```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: http://tus.example.org/files/24e533e02ec3bc40c387f1a0e460e216
Content-Length: 0
```
